#So unit two is all about strings and commenting. So far it's been a little repetitive, but there's been some interesting updates too.

#standard strings can be printed like this
print "a string"

#Integers and floats can be printed too

num = 2
numfloat = 3.4

print "A number can be printed " + str(num) + " and floats can be printed too! " + str(numfloat)
